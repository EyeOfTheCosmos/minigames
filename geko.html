    <h1>About Geko</h1>
    <p>
        Geko is this little guy. He has a lot of jobs because he has a lot of debt to pay off. <br> 
        BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THAT NERD STUFF??<br> What does matter is that these jobs are <i><em>games</em></i> that you can play. <br>
         Cool, right? <br>
         That all. Maybe I'll put something else here later.
         <br>Have fun playing the games. If you do.
    </p>
