    <h1>About Geko</h1>
    <p>
        Geko is this little guy. He has a lot of jobs because he has a lot of debt to pay off. <br> 
        BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THAT NERD STUFF??<br> What does matter is that these jobs are <i><em>games</em></i> that you can play. <br>
         Cool, right? <br>
         That all. Maybe I'll put something else here later.
         <br>Have fun playing the games. If you do.

    <p>It all started when he was 3 years old. Just starting to be able to see because, you know, with features like Geko, you're bound to have a lot of problems. Now, that's not very important. Let's get into why Geko has so much crippling debt and such a terrible life. You see, Geko wanted to be a software developer. The only problem was, this was about 532 years ago, so computers weren't even invented. As you can probably guess, this was a <em>BIG</em> problem. So when he went to college, he just kinda sat there waiting for computers to be invented so he could be a software developer. As you can guess, waiting for around 450 years in college would cost quite a bit of money. Especially since college wasn't even invented either. That's not actually why he has so much debt though. The real reason is because of a single coinflip. He bet $254,235,462,125,457,234.63 and a root beer that the coinflip would be heads. It was tails. And Geko only had $254,235,462,125,457,234.62, with no root beer, so you can probably assume it'd take a while to pay that back. Anyway have fun playing those games. It's okay, they only last for eternity.</p>
